Of course\! Creating add-ins for Anki is a fantastic way to customize it to your exact needs. It requires some knowledge of Python, but it's a very rewarding process.

This guide will walk you through the entire process, from setting up your environment to creating a simple "Hello, World\!" add-in and pointing you toward more advanced resources.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Anki**: You need the desktop version of Anki installed on your computer.
2.  **Python Knowledge**: Anki add-ins are written in Python. You should be comfortable with Python basics (functions, classes, modules, data structures). Anki currently uses Python 3.9, so your code should be compatible.
3.  **Code Editor**: A good code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), Sublime Text, or PyCharm will make writing code much easier.

-----

### Step 1: Find Your Anki Add-ins Folder

This is where your add-in's code will live. Anki loads all subdirectories in this folder as potential add-ins.

  * In Anki, go to the menu: `Tools` \> `Add-ons`.
  * In the Add-ons window, click the button `View Files`.

This will open your computer's file explorer to the `addons21` directory. This is where we'll work.

-----

### Step 2: Create Your First Add-in ("Hello, Anki\!")

Let's create a simple add-in that adds a new menu item under "Tools". When clicked, it will show a message box.

1.  **Create a New Folder**: Inside the `addons21` folder, create a new folder for your add-in. The name doesn't matter for functionality, but it should be descriptive. Let's call it `my_first_addon`.

2.  **Create the Main File**: Inside the `my_first_addon` folder, create a new Python file. **It must be named `__init__.py`**. This is the entry point that Anki will execute when it starts.

3.  **Write the Code**: Open `__init__.py` in your code editor and paste the following code:

<!-- end list -->

```python
# Import necessary components from Anki's code
from aqt import mw  # The main window
from aqt.utils import showInfo, qconnect  # For showing message boxes and connecting signals
from aqt.qt import QAction  # For creating menu items

# This function will be called when the menu item is clicked
def show_hello_message():
    """Shows a simple 'Hello, Anki!' message box."""
    # showInfo is a helper function to display a simple message
    showInfo("Hello, Anki! Your add-in is working.")

# Create a new menu item
action = QAction("Show Hello Message", mw)

# Connect the menu item's 'triggered' signal to our function
# qconnect is a helper that makes connecting signals more reliable
qconnect(action.triggered, show_hello_message)

# Add the menu item to Anki's "Tools" menu
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)

```

#### Code Breakdown:

  * `from aqt import mw`: `aqt` is Anki's GUI toolkit module. `mw` (main window) is the central object in Anki's code. You will use it constantly to access almost everything, like your collection (`mw.col`), the current profile, and UI elements.
  * `from aqt.utils import showInfo, qconnect`: These are helpful utility functions. `showInfo` displays a simple pop-up message. `qconnect` is a safe way to connect an event (like a button click) to a function.
  * `from aqt.qt import QAction`: Anki's user interface is built with the Qt framework (specifically PyQt/PySide). A `QAction` is a standard Qt object representing an action that can be added to menus or toolbars.
  * `show_hello_message()`: This is the simple function that we want to run when our menu item is clicked.
  * `action = QAction(...)`: We create the action and give it a label ("Show Hello Message"). We pass `mw` as the parent, which is good practice for Qt objects.
  * `qconnect(action.triggered, ...)`: This line connects the action's `triggered` signal (which fires when the user clicks it) to our `show_hello_message` function.
  * `mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)`: This is the final step where we take our newly created action and add it to the main window's "Tools" menu.

<!-- end list -->

4.  **Test It\!**: Save the `__init__.py` file and **restart Anki**. After it restarts, click on the `Tools` menu. You should see a new option at the bottom: "Show Hello Message". Click it, and a message box should appear\!

Congratulations, you've just made your first Anki add-in\!

### Core Concepts for More Advanced Add-ins

Now that you have a basic add-in, here are the key concepts you'll need to create more powerful ones.

#### 1\. Hooks

Hooks are the modern and preferred way to modify Anki's behavior. Instead of directly changing Anki's code (monkey-patching), you "hook" your own functions into specific events. This is much safer and less likely to break when Anki updates.

**Example**: Run a function every time the reviewer shows a question.

```python
from anki.hooks import add_hook

def log_card_id(card):
    """Prints the current card's ID to the console."""
    print(f"Showing card with ID: {card.id}")

# Register the function to run whenever the 'reviewer_did_show_question' hook is triggered
add_hook("reviewer_did_show_question", log_card_id)
```

You can find a list of available hooks in the official Anki manual or by searching for `run_hooks` in the [Anki source code](https://github.com/ankitects/anki).

#### 2\. The Collection (`mw.col`)

The `mw.col` object is your gateway to the Anki database. It lets you find, add, and modify notes, cards, decks, and more.

**Example**: Find all cards with the "computer-science" tag.

```python
# Get a list of card IDs (cids) for a specific tag
card_ids = mw.col.find_cards("tag:computer-science")

print(f"Found {len(card_ids)} cards with that tag.")

if card_ids:
    # Get the first card object from its ID
    first_card = mw.col.get_card(card_ids[0])
    # Get the note associated with that card
    note = first_card.note()
    # Access the note's fields (e.g., 'Front')
    front_content = note['Front']
    print(f"The content of the first card's Front field is: {front_content}")
```

#### 3\. Configuration (`config.json`)

If you want your add-in to have user-configurable settings, you can add a `config.json` file to your add-in's folder.

1.  Create `config.json` inside your `my_first_addon` folder.

2.  Add some default settings:

    ```json
    {
        "username": "default_user",
        "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
        "greeting": "Hello"
    }
    ```

3.  Access these settings in your `__init__.py`:

    ```python
    from aqt import mw

    # Load the configuration for the current add-on
    config = mw.addonManager.getConfig(__name__)

    # Now you can use the values
    username = config['username']
    greeting = config['greeting']

    def show_configured_message():
        showInfo(f"{greeting}, {username}!")

    # ... (rest of the code to create the menu item)
    ```

### Development Workflow & Debugging

  * **Reloading**: Restarting Anki for every change is slow. You can use an add-in like [Anki Add-on Debugging](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/104411506) which adds a "Reload" option, or simply use the "Reload" button in the `View Files` section of the Add-ons dialog.
  * **Debugging**:
      * **Print Statements**: `print()` statements will output to the console window you used to launch Anki. If you're on Windows and didn't start it from a terminal, you won't see these.
      * **Anki's Debug Console**: From the main Anki window, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `:` (colon). This opens an interactive Python console where you can inspect objects like `mw` and test code snippets live.

### Packaging and Sharing Your Add-in

When you're ready to share your add-in on AnkiWeb:

1.  **Create `meta.json`**: In your add-in's folder, create a `meta.json` file. This tells AnkiWeb about your add-in.

    ```json
    {
        "name": "My First Add-on",
        "package": "my_first_addon",
        "author": "Your Name",
        "version": "1.0",
        "anki_version": ["2.1.50", "2.1.51"]
    }
    ```

      * `package` must match your folder name.
      * `anki_version` can specify which versions of Anki are compatible.

2.  **Zip the files**: Create a `.zip` file containing all the files in your add-in folder (e.g., `__init__.py`, `config.json`, `meta.json`). The zip file should have the same name as your package folder (e.g., `my_first_addon.zip`).

3.  **Upload**: Go to [AnkiWeb \> Add-ons \> Submit an Add-on](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://ankiweb.net/shared/add) and upload your zip file.
