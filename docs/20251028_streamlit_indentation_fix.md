# Fix: Streamlit IndentationError in streamlit_app.py

Date: 2025-10-28

## Overview

Running the Streamlit app failed with an `IndentationError` reported at `src/streamlit_app.py:55`.
The root cause was an unintended, unclosed triple quote (`"""`) left at the module level just before the `generate_anki_cards` function definition, which broke Python parsing.

## Changes

- Removed an orphan triple quote block at the module level (lines ~45â€“47) in `src/streamlit_app.py`.
- No functional logic changes; this is a minimal syntax fix.

## Impact

- The app can now be parsed and executed by Streamlit without a compilation error.
- No behavior change in card generation, UI, or API integrations.

## How to Verify

1. Compile check (fast):
```bash
python3 -m py_compile src/streamlit_app.py
```
2. Run the app:
```bash
bash run_streamlit.sh
```
- Access the app at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Notes

- Keep `.md` docs in `docs/` with a date-prefixed filename for traceability.
- Keep changes minimal to avoid regressions.
